                                Maps of food access might just reinforce preconceived notions. 
                                Most people looking at these maps probably have an idea of what areas are under-served. 
                                These maps tend to point out problems that won't really suprise a lot of people. 
                                But what do they do to point out potential solutions?

                                The USDA defines "food access" in terms of access to large supermarkets. 
                                A "food desert" is an area without access to a large supermarket. 
                                What's the solution suggested by this definition of food access? 
                                It probably involves building more supermarkets until the food deserts on the map disappear.

                                Supermarkets can be valuable places to buy groceries. But we know there's a lot more to the story than that.
